## App

An app enables the consumer to request an access token through the app key and
secret. With the access token it is possible to request an API endpoint.

### Credentials

An API consumer is not able to access the app credentials directly. In order to 
pass the app credentials to the consumer an administrator account needs to fetch 
the app key and secret from the app and present this information to the user. 
This can be done by an application or manual by an administrator user.
