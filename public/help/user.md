## User

A user can be either a `Consumer` or `Administrator`. An Administrator account 
can request an access token to the backend API with the user name and password. 
A Consumer account can only get an access token through an app.

If a new user is created a password is automatically assigned to the account.
This password is shown once upon creation after that it is not possible to
recover the password.
