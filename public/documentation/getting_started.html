    <h2>Welcome,</h2>

    <p>this API was developed with <a href="http://fusio-project.org">fusio</a>.
    This is a quick introduction to help you get started using the API.</p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>All available API endpoints are shown on the left sidebar</p>

    <h3>Authentication</h3>

    <p>Fusio uses <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">OAuth2</a> for 
    authorization. In order to obtain an access token you have to send an 
    <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4">client credentials</a> 
    request to the following endpoint. The app key and secret must be obtained 
    by the API provider.</p>

    <pre>POST /authorization/token</pre>

    <p>To check whether the authentication was successful you can make an GET 
    request to the endpoint.</p>

    <pre>GET /authorization/whoami</pre>

    <p>If the access token is no longer needed you can revoke the access by 
    making an POST request to the endpoint.</p>

    <pre>POST /authorization/revoke</pre>
