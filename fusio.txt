- on installation we need a database where all settings are stored

- backend
- a user can add datasources from where the api can get data. Datasources should
  be handler like mysql, couchdb, mongodb etc. probably also another api as 
  source
- a user can define an new api endpoint the endpoint includes the corresponding
  table and filter rules
- it is possible to add mapping rules to map from database field to custom 
  fields
- when creating an api endpoint constraints should be detected so that ids can 
  be checked if submitted
- a user can add oauth applications wich can connect to the api
- requests can be limited per application and api endpoint
- add event trigger if an record gets inserted, updated or deleted. I.e. call
  a webhook, add to an messagequeue, send an mail etc.
- add caching rules how often to fetch data from the source

- frontend
- the frontend looks like an developer website from twitter or paypal where 
  users can see the API documentation and download clients
- probably an api status
- possibility for users to register an application
